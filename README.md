## Overview

This repository provides a detailed analysis of school infrastructure in Mozambique, focusing on critical resources such as access to water, electricity, and functional sanitation facilities. Access to quality education and a safe learning environment is essential for student development. In Mozambique, the state of school infrastructure plays a crucial role in ensuring conducive learning conditions.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Preparation**: Explore and clean the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Gain insights into the distribution of schools and their infrastructure.
3. **Visualization**: Present key findings through charts, graphs, and maps.
4. **Insight Identification**: Highlight trends, patterns, and potential areas for improvement in Mozambican school infrastructure.

## Key Findings

### School Distribution

### Resource Analysis

#### Water

- **Lack of Access**: Approximately 60% of educational institutions in Mozambique lack access to water, with northern regions such as Zambézia and Nampula provinces facing the greatest shortages.
- **Potable Water Availability**: Among schools with water access, most have potable water, primarily from boreholes equipped with pumps. Public water supply is more prevalent in Maputo City.

#### Electricity

- **Lack of Access**: Over 80% of educational institutions lack electricity, with Zambézia and Nampula provinces being the most affected. Maputo City has relatively better access.
- **Energy Sources**: The public grid is the primary electricity provider, while solar panels are significant in Cabo Delgado and Niassa. Generators are used in smaller numbers due to high costs.

#### Functional Sanitation Facilities

- **Lack of Facilities**: More than 80% of schools lack operational sanitation facilities.
- **Provincial Trends**: Cabo Delgado and Inhambane exhibit a concerning number of schools with non-functional facilities, failing to meet functional standards.
